# The Chrome Extension

``npm install``

(make sure to close vscode: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39293636/npm-err-error-eperm-operation-not-permitted-rename)

``npm run build``

Then, load the ``build/`` folder to Chrome.


The directory ``old_extension`` contains the old extension code for reference (will remove once new one is finalized)
